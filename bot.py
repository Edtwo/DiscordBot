The clock on the wall seems to taunt me, its hands ticking away, counting down the minutes until I face another day of this torturous challenge.

My morning routine, once a simple and mundane task, has now become a treacherous journey through a minefield of temptation. Even the innocent act of showering has turned into a battlefield. I avoid making any accidental contact with myself like my life depends on it, for fear that I might lose control and succumb to the desires that haunt me.
As I sit down for breakfast, even a harmless banana seems to have transformed into a forbidden fruit of temptation. I cast furtive glances around the room, half-expecting someone to burst through the door and catch me in the act, as if I were committing some heinous crime.

Throughout the day, I walk a tightrope between desire and self-control. Every passing glance at an attractive person or an alluring image sends shivers of terror down my spine. The fear of slipping up is constant, and it gnaws at my conscience like a relentless demon.
My friends, oblivious to my silent struggle, make jokes about No Nut November and the dire consequences of failing the challenge. Little do they know that I am living in a state of perpetual anxiety, desperately clinging to the last shreds of my willpower.

Nightfall brings no relief, as my dreams are now filled with nightmarish scenarios of me giving in to temptation. I wake up in a cold sweat, thankful that it was only a dream, yet still haunted by the terrifying prospect of breaking the vow I've made to myself.

Day 4 of No Nut November has been a relentless battle, and the fear of failure continues to grow. The road ahead seems long and filled with pitfalls, but I must press on, for the terror of giving in is nothing compared to the dread of admitting defeat.""")

Rice comes in many colors. White, black, Yellow, you name it. But my favorite is white sticky rice. White sticky rice, is basically normal rice with but with more water so it is more moist. Genetics have shown that rice has been rice was domesticated 8,000-13,000 years ago in China, near the Pearl River Valley. There are myths about Rice and how it is a gift from the Animals in China. It was said that, during a flood, all the crops been wiped out, and so the people had nothing to eat. Then one day, a dog cane by and gave the people rice grain. They grew it and then hunger disappeared. My Grandpa owns a farm, in which he grows rice. Approximately in 1 cup of uncooked rice there are 2 cups of cooked rice. Rice in my opinion is one of world most creative carbohydrate. You can make anything out of rice. You name it. But what can you do with bread. Nothing. You can literally sculpts things with rice. But with bread, all you can do is stack it. Whats the fun for stacking. With Rice, you can make little balls out of it and chuck it. What can you do with bread. Chuck the whole loaf? Who would in the right mind chuck a loaf of bread. With rice, you can do anything. Anyways leave a comment saying whats your favorite type of grain.")

Meanwhile all the other games that came out this year are overrated, mediocre games with boring, generic and repetitive gameplay, boring and uninteresting narratives and keep telling you what to do every 5 seconds. You and the people that support these kinds of doghit games are everything that is wrong this the gaming industry. These companies give you garbage and you guys eat it up and ask for more. Elden Ring is literally the only game that deserves to be called a true video game. Everything else is a joke and a scam. So fuck you, fuck all the people that pay for it, and fuck these companies that keep pumping these shitty mediocre kiddy games. I hope all of you fuckers die.

I violently, aggressively, explosively, intensely, passionately, vehemently sharted my jorts in a McDonald‚Äôs hamburger shaped seat on March 4th, 1998. It smelled like spiced Gouda aged in a hot metal can with a slight aura of pickled onions and expired diesel fuel. As I looked down my leg, I saw a trickle of what appeared to be an orange, brownish-red nuclear Shart substance, something akin to a chemical weapon. The liquid Shart scent filled the air of the restaurant, causing customers to dry heave, cover their nose; I even recall an employee asking the staff ‚Äúwho took a shit in the deep fryer?‚Äù

The health department ended up showing up and doing a thorough corporate investigation of that particular location. Turns out they were breaking all types of health protocols and were promptly shut down, and if you think about it, it was all because of sharting my jorts.""")

Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.

Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.

There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called Linux distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux!""")
