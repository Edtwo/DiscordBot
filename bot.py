The clock on the wall seems to taunt me, its hands ticking away, counting down the minutes until I face another day of this torturous challenge.

My morning routine, once a simple and mundane task, has now become a treacherous journey through a minefield of temptation. Even the innocent act of showering has turned into a battlefield. I avoid making any accidental contact with myself like my life depends on it, for fear that I might lose control and succumb to the desires that haunt me.
As I sit down for breakfast, even a harmless banana seems to have transformed into a forbidden fruit of temptation. I cast furtive glances around the room, half-expecting someone to burst through the door and catch me in the act, as if I were committing some heinous crime.

Throughout the day, I walk a tightrope between desire and self-control. Every passing glance at an attractive person or an alluring image sends shivers of terror down my spine. The fear of slipping up is constant, and it gnaws at my conscience like a relentless demon.
My friends, oblivious to my silent struggle, make jokes about No Nut November and the dire consequences of failing the challenge. Little do they know that I am living in a state of perpetual anxiety, desperately clinging to the last shreds of my willpower.

Nightfall brings no relief, as my dreams are now filled with nightmarish scenarios of me giving in to temptation. I wake up in a cold sweat, thankful that it was only a dream, yet still haunted by the terrifying prospect of breaking the vow I've made to myself.

Day 4 of No Nut November has been a relentless battle, and the fear of failure continues to grow. The road ahead seems long and filled with pitfalls, but I must press on, for the terror of giving in is nothing compared to the dread of admitting defeat.""")

Rice comes in many colors. White, black, Yellow, you name it. But my favorite is white sticky rice. White sticky rice, is basically normal rice with but with more water so it is more moist. Genetics have shown that rice has been rice was domesticated 8,000-13,000 years ago in China, near the Pearl River Valley. There are myths about Rice and how it is a gift from the Animals in China. It was said that, during a flood, all the crops been wiped out, and so the people had nothing to eat. Then one day, a dog cane by and gave the people rice grain. They grew it and then hunger disappeared. My Grandpa owns a farm, in which he grows rice. Approximately in 1 cup of uncooked rice there are 2 cups of cooked rice. Rice in my opinion is one of world most creative carbohydrate. You can make anything out of rice. You name it. But what can you do with bread. Nothing. You can literally sculpts things with rice. But with bread, all you can do is stack it. Whats the fun for stacking. With Rice, you can make little balls out of it and chuck it. What can you do with bread. Chuck the whole loaf? Who would in the right mind chuck a loaf of bread. With rice, you can do anything. Anyways leave a comment saying whats your favorite type of grain.")
